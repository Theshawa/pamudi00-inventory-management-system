Typically, the following files should be included in the Controller component:

PHP files that contain the logic for processing user inputs and updating the Model. For example, if the user submits a form to add a new item to the dashboard, the PHP file that processes the form submission would be part of the Controller component.

PHP files that retrieve data from the Model and pass it to the View. For example, if the dashboard displays a list of items, the PHP file that retrieves the items from the Model and passes them to the View would be part of the Controller component.

JavaScript files that provide dynamic behavior for the user interface. For example, if the dashboard includes charts or graphs that update in real-time, the JavaScript files that implement this behavior would be part of the Controller component.

In general, the Controller component should include any PHP or JavaScript files that are responsible for processing user inputs, updating the Model, and managing the flow of data between the Model and View. It should not include HTML or CSS files, which should be part of the View component.
